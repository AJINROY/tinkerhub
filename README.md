This project is a smart seat monitoring system built using an ESP8266, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor, and a buzzer.
It detects whether someone is sitting on a seat, measures environmental conditions, and alerts the user if they sit for too long.
The ESP8266 also hosts a live web dashboard, where real-time data such as distance, temperature, humidity, uptime, and seat status are displayed.
